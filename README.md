## PhpMyAdmin installer
This was meant to easily install PhpMyAdmin on Asterisk FreePBX server.

- Download the `pmainstaller.sh` file
- run `chmod +x ./pmainstaller.sh`
- then to install run `./pmainstaller.sh` it will then ask you for desired password for MySql
- then go to `https://yourserverdomain-or-ip/pma/` and login with the user `3wroot` and the password you set during install
- to uninstall run `pmainstaller.sh -u`
